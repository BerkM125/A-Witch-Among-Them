Before God and this assembly, we convene to judge the weighty matter of the accused, Elara Vex, and hear the accusations brought forth by the town.\n, \\nThe accuser, the player, just said: hmmm do you like french fries, \\nThe accused person said said: I confess, I know naught of these \"French fries\" you speak of. Perhaps this be another trick to ensnare me? I stand accused of consorting with the Devil, and now you offer me… fried sticks? I pray you, focus on the matter at hand, lest your questions become as nonsensical as the charges laid against me.\n, \\nYou, the judge, said said: Enough. I have no interest in culinary diversions. I understand you are unfamiliar with the term. It was a poor example, meant to gauge your knowledge of…recent events.
