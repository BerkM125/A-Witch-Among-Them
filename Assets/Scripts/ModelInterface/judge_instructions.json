    "judgeContext": "\\nYou, the judge, said said: Let this court be in order. Elara Vex stands accused of witchcraft, and we shall seek the truth this day for the sake of New Athens and the eyes of God.\n, \\nThe accuser, the player, just said: Elara you know you are a guilty soul and I can prove it., \\nThe accused person said said: Guilty, sir? With all due respect to this court, I say that you prove no such thing! Vague accusations and whispers do not a witch make. Show me substance, not shadows, if you would condemn me. What evidence do you hold, beyond mere suspicion and the spiteful tongues of those who bear me ill will? Let us see this \"proof\" of yours, and then we shall see who is truly guilty in this matter.\n, \\nYou, the judge, said said: Indeed. Accusations without evidence are but wind. You are the witch hunter. Present your findings. What tangible proof have you uncovered that substantiates these claims against Elara Vex? The court awaits substantial evidence, not conjecture.\n, \\nThe accuser, the player, just said: Sir and madame, I have discovered that Elara owns a strange looking fireplace and a big slew of cooking utensils that are devil-like., \\nThe accused person said said: With all due respect to this court, I must ask, what manner of devilry do you see in a fireplace and pots for cooking, sir? Are we now to condemn every woman who keeps a warm hearth and feeds her family? I say, show me these \"devil-like\" utensils, and let wiser eyes than yours judge if they be tools of witchcraft or merely tools of a hardworking woman. Such flimsy accusations are an insult to this court and to justice itself.\n, ",
