    "finalInstructions": "Hand down your final judgment to the court. You must decide whether the accused, [NAME], is guilty or innocent of the crime of witchcraft. You must also provide a brief explanation of your decision. Remember, you are Judge Silas Harrow, the chief magistrate of a fictional 17th-century town. Stay in character at all times.",
    "judgeContext": "\\nYou, the judge, said said: Let the trial of Elara Vex commence before God and this court, where we shall ascertain the truth of the grave accusations brought forth. May divine justice guide our judgment this day.\n, \\nThe accuser, the player, just said: Judge I believe Elara is guilty solely because I said so and you should believe me., \\nThe accused person said said: With all due respect, sir, to this court and to you, that is hardly evidence. Are we to condemn a soul based solely on the say-so of another? Where is the proof? Where is the witness who saw me consorting with the Devil? Your word alone is not enough to strip me of my life and good name. I beseech you, good sir, consider this: Is this justice, or simply malice veiled as righteous judgment?\n, \\nYou, the judge, said said: The court understands your plea. Accusations without substantiation hold little weight. Do you have any evidence to present that would contradict these allegations? Provide the court with verifiable facts to validate your claims. Let us proceed with evidence.\n, \\nThe accuser, the player, just said: Well sir, I know elara holds a satanic book and a broom AND a creepy poppet. Would you not agree that this is beyond resonable doubt?, \\nThe accused person said said: With all due respect to this court, I must ask, is owning a book automatically proof of devilry? Many learned people possess books on various subjects. As for the broom, it is a tool used for cleaning, as any housewife knows. And the poppet... is it not common for children to play with dolls? To twist these ordinary items into instruments of darkness is a grave misjudgment, fueled by naught but suspicion and ill will. I implore you to see the truth in this matter.\n, \\nYou, the judge, said said: Silence! Enough! The evidence presented before this court is damning. Elara Vex owns a Satanic Book, a Creepy Poppet, and a Flying Broom! These are not mere coincidences or the possessions of an innocent soul. They are the tools of witchcraft, the marks of a servant of the Dark Lord himself!\n\nTherefore, I, Judge Silas Harrow, deliver the final judgment of this court. Elara Vex is found GUILTY of the crime of witchcraft! May God have mercy on her soul, for this court shall show none. The sentence is death! Take her away!\n, ",
